# Reflectcord

REST and Websocket compatability layer for Discord->Revolt

## Features

### Configurable

Need only the Discord API, but not the CDN? Simply turn it off in the configuration file!

### Secure

Reflectcord runs outside of your Revolt instance, and has to run under the same restrictions as a normal Revolt user.

### Portable

Because Reflectcord is designed to run outside of the instance, it can be used on any instance you desire.
